            <h1>Let's Talk About Coding</h1>
            <h2>11/5/2017</h2>
            <p>
                On this day 10 minutes ago, I started a blog that I hope to dedicate to programming. 
                I'm going to be honest, I like to code. I think it's some really fun stuff to do. I
                don't really understand it all, but I try. Perhaps through this blog I'll gain a further
                understanding of the art, and improve all the projects I forget I've dedicated myself to.
            </p>
            <p>
                First things first, I know a bit of C++. I consider that by and far my favorite language
                to program in, and I'll probably post a bunch using it. My understanding is that C++ is
                not accepted by certain individuals who call it "too bulky," "unnecessary", and "ugly"
                - amongst other things. Now that's just real damn rude, don't you think? It's a perfectly
                valid language. It's got all the cool things these days, like lambdas and garbage collection
                (shared pointers) and dynamic allocation and whatever else the current hipster language
                is doing. And besides - what kind of argument is "ugly"? It's a programming language. If
                you're in the discipline for the aesthetic value you're doing it wrong.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also know Java, learned it before C++. I mess around in Lua on occasion. Overall not too
                shabby for a beginner. Doesn't mean I'm an expert in any, but you find far too many blogs
                with people who are god damn experts in their language and you're like "well wtf I don't
                understand half these things" and I think having a blog by someone who <i>almost</i> knows
                what they're doing is a big help.
            </p>
            <p>
                That's my philosophy and I'm sticking to it. I'll try and post once a day.

            <h1>first post</h1>
            <h2>11/5/2017</h2>
            <p>Hello World</p>
            <p>The following is a test at syntax highlighting:</p>
            <pre><code class="c++">#include&lt;iostream&gt;
    
int main(void){
    std::cout &lt;&lt; "Hello, world!" &gt;&gt; std::endl;
    return 0;
}</code></pre>
